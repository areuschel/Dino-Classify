  This document was prepared for Dr. Megan Whitney by graduate students in STAT495: Data Science Consulting. Students worked with lab images of fossils to build and research image classifier and detection models. This report includes recommendations for data collection, organization, and long-term storage, along with example images and a proposed folder architecture. We also provide a concise overview of the neural network models evaluated during the project.
